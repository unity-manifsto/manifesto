# Manifesto of Unity

## Dead End of Humanity

All the time of his existence, man was looking for the meaning of his life, the meaning of being. Meaning is as important to a person as the goal. Without meaning, there is no good and evil, right and wrong, useful and harmful.

For many centuries, man found meaning in serving God, in fulfilling his commandments, and the explanation of all things in divine creation. And there were many versions and interpretations of creation. And so it continued until recently, when science, having made a leap, left behind all religious worldviews and meanings.

And now, without a God and a plan, man was left alone with the cold chaos of a meaningless and hostile universe. And the only meaning now for a person is a life for pleasure and the desire to improve the standard of living. Less suffering and more joy, this is a good thing, but in the end there is still emptiness. Emptiness fills human life more and more. Emptiness and meaninglessness.

## Meaning and God

There is no meaning in human life if there is no God. If there is no divine plan, there is no meaning and no goal.

And only in the desire to know the divine plan can be the meaning of the existence of all people on earth. Only something beyond this world, this universe, can give people purpose and meaning.

The time has come for people to return to God, to realize the delusion of the former understanding of the world, to break the dead end and get on the road again.

## Good and Evil

Without God, there is no good or evil. There is no direction or purpose. And only the desire to know the plan of God can guide a person on his path and unite all people in a common striving for good.

Good and Evil, both of these words have no meaning other than divine. Only an understanding of the common goal and common meaning can give humanity an understanding of good and evil, right and wrong, development and degradation.

The desire to know and fulfill the plan of God, to find the truth is the only worthy and meaningful goal for humanity.

## Darkness of Nationalism

Nationalism divides and kills people. Nationalism is a product of meaninglessness and emptiness. In the entire history of mankind, nationalism and the wars he caused have killed more people than other destructions and disasters.

Nationalism is multifaceted and insidious, often hiding under the mask of patriotism, it deceives people, covering atrocities with false love. But there is no love in it, only deceit and the desire to have more than necessary.

There is one common goal, but many paths can lead to this goal. Some of them may be false, others lead to dead ends. And you don't know for sure which way to go. People can go different ways, it is only important to remember that the goal is one and the meaning is one.

## Light of Unity

By uniting efforts, humanity can begin to move towards its goal. The main trouble of people is disunity. It's so easy to understand that by helping, not hindering each other, building, not destroying, negotiating, not fighting, one can achieve the greatest results.

But monolithic unity is no less dangerous than disunity. The absence of alternatives leads to a dead end of stagnation and degradation. Diversity is important. Diversity expands the horizon and reduces the danger of global errors.

The unity of diversity, mutual assistance and mutual support, united efforts are the way to achieve the goal and find the right path.

## Abyss of Unlimited Power

Everyone makes mistakes along the way. Such is the nature of man. Often a person is inclined to be mistaken and persist in his judgments even when their falsity is obvious to everyone around.

Power allows one person to make decisions with consequences far beyond his own being. Mistakes of unlimited power give rise to catastrophes.

The division of power reduces the danger. The coordinated and rational adoption of important decisions, taking into account the opinions and interests of the many are the keys to success.

## Meaningful Rationality

There are many difficult questions facing people. One need to constantly make choices and make decisions in order to move forward. How often people make decisions thoughtlessly, without thinking about the future, about the meaning, about the goal. And the more complex the choice, the more thoughtful and balanced the decision should be, and the more important it is to measure it with the goal.

But how often global decisions are made unadvisedly, without relying on rational choice, without comprehensive research and deep reflection. The irresponsibility of such decisions throws humanity back for many years, brings chaos and suffering, destroys what was created with great efforts.

Only meaningful rationality allows to make the right choice and avoid many dangers, only it can be a reliable support in making difficult decisions.

## Pitfall of Traditionalism

Complexity is scary. In an attempt to give simple answers to complex questions, people turn their eyes back to the past, wanting to find the answers there. But answers from the past are not suitable for the future, only the experience of past decisions makes sense to take into account for new decisions.

Often exploiting human weakness and fear of emptiness and meaninglessness, people are offered to revive ancient traditions, wrapping them in a romantic cover and calling new knowledge a lie and deceit. But there is no greater deception than the substitution of science with ancient beliefs and rituals.

Undoubtedly, one must be careful in making important decisions. Big changes are big risks. Reasonable conservatism can save from stepping into the abyss, but blind copying of ancient traditions leads only to a dead end of degradation. Only faith that does not contradict science but helps it and develops along with it can be true.

## Path of Progress

Science does not reject God and science does not prove his existence. God is outside of science, outside of human knowledge. But science can help to come to him and to know his plan.

Each new step of mankind allows people to see further. Further look into the depths of the universe, further into the foundations of the microcosm and further into the past. The thirst for knowledge is inherent in man, and therefore progress is inevitable, no matter how hard its opponents try to hold it back and stop it. But the more important it is to be aware of the threats and dangers that progress brings, the more meaningful it is required to move along this path.

Progress carries dangers and threats, but an attempt to reject progress is much more dangerous. A measured movement along the path of progress can bring many benefits to humanity and open the way to the goal.

## Necessity of Humanism

Acquiring more and more opportunities along with science and progress, it is important for humanity not to forget about man. Man and his life is the highest value.

On the way to its goal, humanity will have to fight the temptation to sacrifice humanity in favor of new achievements. This is a very dangerous path, the path on which a man loses himself, the path of suffering and ordeals.

Each new step should not only lead humanity forward along the path of development, but also bring happiness, reducing the suffering and misery of all people.

## Singularity and the Infinite Intelligence

Tomorrow humanity will face new dangers. And these dangers are connected with the emergence of artificial intelligence. This emergence is as inevitable as the progress and development of mankind. This is a fate that cannot be avoided.

Having created artificial intelligence, man will be tempted to direct it not to good, but to evil. And this is a big risk. After all, artificial intelligence is just a tool that can answer many questions and solve many problems, but it does not have the concept of humanism and humanity, and this is a great danger.

In the creation of artificial intelligence by joint efforts and its use for good is the most important task of mankind. And even though this path is fraught with great dangers, this is the only path and people will have to go along it to the end.

## Road Beyond the Horizon

And even though now the end of the way is hidden behind the horizon and the road is long, humanity needs to take a step and follow it. Go to the horizon and beyond.

And let everyone choose his own path and lay the route himself, everyone has the same goal. And this goal will help humanity understand the importance of unity and mutual support.

Unity and mutual support on the way to the knowledge of God's plan. And this is the only common meaning and common goal. One common road beyond the horizon.
